# OfflineAuthenticator

Nothing much to say here, usually most of time this class is useless, you can simply give assign a string to a variable typed as `AuthenticateResult`.

## Authenticate

```cs
var authenticator =  new OfflineAuthenticator("Name");
var result = authenticator.Authenticate();
```
