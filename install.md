# Install

It's too simple that I don't even know what to say here.

## Visual Studio

Select `Nuget package manager` in your project, and search for `ModuleLauncher.Re`, and hit the `install` button, so now you have installed ModuleLauncher.Re.

## .NET CLI

Open your terminal, and type:

```
dotnet add package ModuleLauncher.Re
```
