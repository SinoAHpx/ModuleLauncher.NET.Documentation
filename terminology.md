# Terminology

- `MinecraftEntry`: most important concept in this library, it contains foundamental information of a Minecraft version, which is:
    - `Json`: deserialized entity of Minecraft json file, have some basic information.
    - `Tree`: tree structure of a Minecraft, like where is the Jar file located, library directory, assets directory, etc. Here is a example of this tree hierarchy:
        - `.minecraft`
            - `assets`
                - `indexes`
            - `libraries`
            - `mods`
            - `resourcepacks`
            - `texturepacks`(for legacy Minecrafts)
            - `saves`
            - `versions`
                - `1.19`
                    - `natives`
                    - `1.19.jar`
                    - `1.19.json`
- `MinecraftResolver`: another important stuff in the library, you an initiaize a `MinecraftResolver` instance with a path of .minecraft. Main character of this class is being factory that produces `MinecraftEntry` with `Minecraft ID`.
- `Minecraft ID`: in the example tree above, `1.19` is the `Minecraft ID`. once you have a `Minecraft ID`, you can grab a `MinecraftEntry` with it by using `MinecraftResolver`.
- `LibraryResolver`: get a list of `LibraryEntry`, represent the files in `libraries` directory which is Minecraft's necessary. 
- `AssetsResolver`: get a list of `AssetEntry`, same as above, it represent files in `assets` directory.
